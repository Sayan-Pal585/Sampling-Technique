Sample Survey Techniques 

# Population & Sample
Population is the entire pool from which a statistical Sample is drawn. 
A Population may refer to an entire group of people, objects, events, measurements etc. 
A Sample is a representative part of population.

Example: 
Census data: Collection of Country Population on various aspect of socio-economic factors. 

# Simple Random Sampling:
Definitions:
Random Sample is a sample that is chosen randomly. It could be more accurately called a randomly chosen sample. Random samples are used to avoid bias and other unwanted effects.

Simple Random Sample is a method of selection of a sample comprising of n number of sampling units out of the population having N number of sampling units such that every sampling unit has an equal chance of being chosen. 

Without Replacement(WOR) & With Replacement(WR):
The samples can be drawn in two possible ways. 
--The sampling units are chosen without replacement in the sense that the units once are chosen are not placed back in the population. 
--The sampling units are chosen with replacement in the sense that the chosen units are placed back in the population.

# Simple Random Sampling Without Replacement (SRSWOR) : 
SRSWOR is a method of selection of n units out of the N units one by one such that at any stage of selection, any one of the remaining units have the same chance of being selected, i.e. 1/N.
# Simple Random Sampling With Replacement (SRSWR) :
SRSWR is a method of selection of n units out of the N units one by one such that at each stage of selection, each unit has an equal chance of being selected, i.e., 1/N 

--Difference between SRSWR & SRSWOR is when we sample WR the two values are independent. This means first result doesn’t affect second result, but when we sample WOR the first result affects happening of second result.

# Procedure of Selection of a random sample follows the following steps: 
--Identify the N units in the population with the numbers 1 to N. 
--Choose any random number arbitrarily in the random number table and start reading numbers. 
--Choose the sampling unit whose serial number corresponds to the random number drawn from the table of random numbers. 
--In the case of SRSWR, all the random numbers are accepted ever if repeated more than once. In the case of SRSWOR, if any random number is repeated, then it is ignored, and more numbers are drawn.

# PROs
--Better chances that the sample represents the population.
--Can be conducted in shorter time duration.
--Cost less money.
--Involves lesser degree of judgement.
--Comparatively easier way of sampling.

# CONs
--Risks of selecting samples from a few variations only.
--Redundant & monotony
--Stratified Random Sampling can be tedious and time-consuming job to those who are not keen towards handling such data.

# Simple Random Sample vs Random Sample
A simple random sample is similar to a random sample. The difference between the two is that with a simple random sample, each object in the population has an equal chance of being chosen. With random sampling, each object does not necessarily have an equal chance of being chosen. 

Example: If we catch fish, measure them, and immediately return them to the water before continuing with the sample, this is a WR design, because we might end up catching and measuring the same fish more than once. However, if we do not return the fish to the water (e.g., if we eat the fish), this becomes a WOR design.

# Stratified Random Sampling:
Stratified Random Sampling is method selecting samples from the population is by dividing the whole population into small strata consisting up of elements with some similar characteristics and then choosing such number of samples from each of them to proportional to the size of the stratum.

# Procedure of Selections:
Divide the population of N units into k strata. Let the 𝑖th stratum has 𝑁i, i=1,2,...,k number of units. 
--Strata are constructed such that they are non-overlapping and homogeneous with respect to the characteristic under study such that  ∑(𝑖=1)^𝑘 𝑁i = 𝑁.
--Draw a sample of size ni  from 𝑖th (𝑖= 1, 2,...,k) stratum using SRS (preferably WOR) independently from each stratum. 
--All the sampling units drawn from each stratum will constitute a stratified sample of size 
𝑛=∑(𝑖=1)^𝑘 𝑛i 

# PROs
--Stratified Random Sampling provides better precision as it takes the samples proportional to the random population.
--Stratified Random Sampling helps minimizing the biasness in selecting the samples.
--Stratified Random Sampling ensures that no any section of the population are underrepresented or overrepresented.
--As this method provides greater precision, greater level of accuracy can be achieved even by using small size of samples. This saves resources.

# CONs
--Stratified Random Sampling requires more administrative works as compared with Simple Random Sampling.
--It is sometimes hard to classify each kind of population into clearly distinguished classes.
--Stratified Random Sampling can be tedious and time-consuming job to those who are not keen towards handling such data.

# Systematic Random Sampling
Systematic Sampling technique is operationally more convenient than simple random sampling. It also ensures, at the same time that each unit has an equal probability of inclusion in the sample. In this method of sampling, the first unit is selected with the help of random numbers, and the remaining units are selected automatically according to a predetermined pattern.

# Procedure of Selection
Suppose the N units in the population are numbered 1 to N in some order. Suppose further that N is expressible as a product of two intergers n and k, so that N=nk

To draw a sample of size n.
- Select a random number between 1 and k.
- Suppose it is i.
- Select the firat unit, whose serial number is i.
- Select every k-th unit after i-th unit.
- The sample will contain i,i+k,1+2k,...,i+(n-1)k serial number units.

# PROs
--It is easier to draw a sample and often easier to execute it without mistakes. This is more advantageous when the drawing is done in fields and offices as there may be substantial saving in time. 
--The cost is low, and the selection of units is simple. Much less training is needed for surveyors to collect units through systematic sampling.
--The systematic sample is spread more evenly over the population. So no large part will fail to be represented in the sample. The sample is evenly spread, and cross-section is better. Systematic sampling fails in case of too many blanks. 

# CONs
--Size of the population may not be known before the sampling starts
--Assumption that the population is uniform may not always prove to be true.
